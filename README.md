# About us
We are a startup company, have an idea to develop a platform for buying and selling properties (apartment, commercial spaces).

Till now we have been working in real estate in Kolkata area since 2010. The first customer for our website is [Vaishnodevi Realty](vdr.md) (VDR). There is a target to sell 50 apartments under Century Mansion project by Dec-2024. 

There are 2 more projects with same name, Century Mansion phase 1 and Century Mansion phase 2 going to start soon. The plan is to construct 150 + 50, total 200 apartments and the target is to start booking for these projects.

In addition to this we have plan for adding value added service (VAS) through an ecommerce website. Again the customer is VDR. There is 5000 sq ft commercial space at Century Mansion which would be used for physical stores. We have to develop online shopping website.

# Problem and opportunity

## Project [propertyvali.in](project-propertyvali.md)
The problem which is seen today is that there are websites for buying, selling and renting properties but they are not providing additional services, it works as a platform for listing properties. 

Here we are planning to provide end to end solution to the builders. We can enlist there projects and properties, generate leads with digital marketing, handle the leads and close a deal just like a property broker does, but our goal is to provide these services with advanced technology.

We can take leverage of enlisting and selling properties of Century Mansion, Century Mansion Phase 1 and Century Mansion Phase 2. 

## Project [wonderful homes](project-wonderfulhomes.md)
The problem seen with the home buyers today is they don't have one stop website or app where they can find everything related to new house or apartment like layers, civil engineers, architects, interior decorator, painters, carpenters, building material and hardware suppliers. To solve this problem we have plan to start physical stores in a big space where we can accommodate some if not all of the sales and services supported by online ecommerce website which have full range of sales and supplies.

# Target audience
